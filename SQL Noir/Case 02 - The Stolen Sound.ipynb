    "\n",
    "In the neon glow of 1980s Los Angeles, the West Hollywood Records store was rocked by a daring theft. A prized vinyl record, worth over $10,000, vanished during a busy evening, leaving the store owner desperate for answers. Vaguely recalling the details, you know the incident occurred on July 15, 1983, at this famous store. Your task is to track down the thief and bring them to justice.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve the crime scene report for the record theft using the known date and location.\n",
    "2. Retrieve witness records linked to that crime scene to obtain their clues.\n",
    "3. Use the clues from the witnesses to find the suspect in the suspects table.\n",
    "4. Retrieve the suspect's interview transcript to confirm the confession."
